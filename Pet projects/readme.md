# Binary Search in Python (Recursive and Iterative)

Searching for an element’s presence in a list is usually done using linear search and binary search. Linear search is time-consuming and memory expensive but is the simplest way to search for an element. On the other hand, Binary search is effective mainly due to the reduction of list dimension with each recursive function call or iteration. A practical implementation of binary search is autocompletion.
## Python Binary Search Algorithm:

The objective of this project is to create a simple python program to implement binary search. It can be implemented in two ways: recursive (function calls) and iterative.
## Project Prerequisites:

The project uses loops and functions to implement the search function. Hence good knowledge of python loops and function calls is sufficient to understand the code flow.

## Project File Structure:

Let’s have a look at the steps to build binary search python project:

1. Recursive approach

    Function definition
    Read inputs, sort and call function

2. Iterative approach

    Read inputs and sort
    Loop for binary search
