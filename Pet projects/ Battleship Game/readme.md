# Battleship game (ongoing)


## TODO
### Make multiple battleships:
     You will need to be careful because you need to make sure that you do not place battleships on top of each other on the game board.
     You will also want to make sure that you balance the size of the board with the number of ships so the game is still challenging and fun to play.
### Make battleships of different sizes:
    This is trickier than it sounds. All the parts of the battleship need to be vertically or horizontally touching.
    You will need to make sure you do not accidentally place part of a ship off the side of the board.
### Make your game a two-player game:
    Use functions to allow your game to have more features like rematches, statistics and more!
